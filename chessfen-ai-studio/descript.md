# Chess Arena - App Specification

**Core Concept**: Chess Arena is an interactive chess application where users play as White against an AI opponent (Black). The app combines gameplay with an optional coaching system that provides move suggestions and position analysis. The entire game state persists across sessions, and the UI features a modern glassmorphism design with light/dark mode support.
